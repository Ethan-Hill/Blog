## Who am I?

I’m Ethan, a junior software engineer graduate who just started his first role as a frontend engineer. I’m currently 18 and just left college with a Extended Diploma in Software Engineering & Development. Now this qualification means mostly nothing towards what I mainly work on due to my line of work being all self taught.

## What do I do?

I mainly work with the frontend using frameworks like React and Vue to create web applications that either intrest me or have a purpose. I do also work with the backend using NodeJs with frameworks like ExpressJS and NestJs.

## What lead me to software engineering?

Since I was young I was introduced to technology through system building and working with operating systems including Windows and Linux. When I left high school I wanted to find something that would interest me and allow me to explore new aspects of technology, So I joined a software engineering course at college.

## Where am I now?

Leaving college in May 2021 has left me with the abiliy to find work, during my last few weeks I applied to multiple roles that interested me and after multiple interviews I was offered multiple roles and I was shocked. I landed a Junior frontend developer position which I'm starting on July 7th, 2021.

## Finaly note

I'm ecstatic to start my career as a frontend developer and get the opportunity to work with a team on projects and involve myself in something I love to do. Self taught development can lead to a real job, you just need to work hard to get one and learn what you can during your journey.
